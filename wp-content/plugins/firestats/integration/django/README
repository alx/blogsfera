Django Firestats integration middleware
===========================================

INSTALLING

In your django site's settings.py add the middleware to the installed middleware list MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES by putting:
   your_site.middleware.firestats.FireStatsIntegrationMiddleware
This assumed you have a your_site/middleware directory and put firestats.py from this archive there.
Now add a new variable to settings.py to tell the middleware how to run firestats. Add the line:
   FIRESTATS_DIRECTORY = '/var/www/firestats'
Or the appropriate equivalent for your system.
Have your firestats and django environments working and you should be good to go (worked for me).
